# How positive are 2016's candidates during presidential debates?
This project was created to calculate the sentiment for each candidate's speech during the presidential debates. The transcripts came from [here](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/debates.php) and the natural language processor used [www.text-processing.com's API](http://text-processing.com/demo/sentiment/).

You can see the charts and writeup for this analysis at (my blog post)[http://alexpetralia.com/datablog/2016/2/21/just-how-positive-are-2016s-candidates-during-presidential-debates].
